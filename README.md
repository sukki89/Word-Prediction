# Word-Prediction
CS 263A - NLP

Word prediction is an important NLP problem in which we want to predict the correct word in a given context. 
Word completion utilities, predictive text entry systems, writing aids, and language translation are some of common word prediction applications. 
The goal of the project is to build q utility which can read the userâ€™s mind and predict the next word in a partially typed sentence.
The options for the next word will be displayed on a pop-up section near the text area, next to the cursor. 
Input : Any partially constructed sentence given by the user. 
Output : List of words that could be the next word in the sentence in the given context.
