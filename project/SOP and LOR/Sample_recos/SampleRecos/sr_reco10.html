<font size="2" face="Verdana">I was very glad to learn that my student, Mr.ABC , 
is applying for graduate study in your Engineering school. I am proud to have a 
student like him under me. I have been his teacher for four semesters, since 
1997, in the Department of Electronic Engineering. In these two years he has 
grown into a very mature individual. He has always shown keenness to study 
further. It is very clear to me that he has the requisites for a master’s 
degree.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">In these subjects, his performance has been above 
average. He has shown great promise by venturing beyond the scope of the subject 
syllabi. He has drawn my attention with his resourceful and witty ideas. I have 
taught him the concepts of electronics (oscillators etc.), electromagnetic field 
theory, digital modulation and coding techniques. He is an industrious, devoted 
and clever student as far as academics are concerned, which is unmistakably seen 
in the praiseworthy marks that he has incessantly achieved.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">I had conducted ABC’s Tutorials in Electromagnetic 
Fields and Waves (Semester V) in which he regularly secured above average 
result. I&nbsp; was also in-charge of&nbsp; his&nbsp; Laboratory (Semester VI) for Satellite, 
T.V. and Video Technology. He was very disciplined during the lab-work and I was 
content with his capability to grasp and perceive new concepts. Seeing his 
experimental skills in the laboratory, in my opinion, he has immense research 
ability.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He is a student who will 
work very hard towards the fulfillment of any responsibility he undertakes. By 
helping him procure a graduate program in your college you will provide him with 
a challenging and lucrative future, while networking as much as possible with 
industry experts and mentors while he is still in your school. This will also 
arm him with practical information on technological advances ensuring his value 
in future. I believe that he has the aptitude and expertise for graduate study, 
and augmented with your practical information and technological advances his 
value in future is ensured. I recommend him for graduate studies and appropriate 
financial support.</font></p>
