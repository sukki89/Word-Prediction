It gives me pleasure to introduce ABC to your Institute. I have known for more 
than three years now and have taught him Computer Programming in Pascal, 
Computer Methodology and Algorithms and Computer Graphics in these years.</font></p>

He has performed very well in the subjects I have taught him with his marks in 
Computer Programming in Pascal, Computer Methodology and Algorithms being among 
the top 5% in his class. </font><span style="color:black"><font size="2">I have 
observed that, during his laboratory sessions he comes with innovative solutions 
to the problems presented to him.</font></span></span></p>

ABC has setup the UUCP email connection of our Institute. During this time, I 
noticed his dedication and commitment to his project. He understood the 
intricacies of the project and explained the users the simplicity of using it. 
His technical knowledge is good and has taken part in many technical quizzes. He 
won the first prize in the Technical Quiz organized by the Electrical and 
Electronics Department. He keeps on updating his knowledge by attending and 
organizing various technical seminars.</font></p>

I attended a lecture that he delivered on “Strings in C” at the ACE “C 
Workshop”. His lecture had a smooth flow of thought and was well organized. He 
is very good and fluent in speaking English. There was an excellent response to 
his lecture. His abilities as a teacher were clearly displayed from the way he 
conducted the lecture and the lab sessions at the workshop.</font></span></p>
