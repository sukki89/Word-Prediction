<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a matter of immense pleasure in writing a letter of reference for 
Ms ABC. I have known ABC for the past 2 years. I was her 
internal project guide for her project work during the VIIth and VIIIth 
semesters of her undergraduate course in Computer Engineering. Her project dealt 
with the “_____________&quot;.&nbsp; I have also 
instructed her for a semester in Object Oriented Programming Methodology.<O:P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know 
ABC to be a studious and motivated student. Her project work 
gave me a very good idea about her qualities as an individual. It brought out 
her ability to work successfully as part of a team towards common project goals. 
Through her perseverance and dedication, she completed all her project 
activities on time. Her presentation and report on the project conveyed a good 
understanding of the subject. All project expectations were met and this was 
appreciated at the Research Centre. Consequently, she received very good grades 
on her project work assignments.<O:P> </O:P></font></P>

</SPAN>As 
a teacher in the class and the laboratory, I noticed the enthusiasm with which 
she carried out her assignments and I’m very happy to say that she was always 
among those students who completed their assignments well before time. I found 
her to be warm, self confident and very much open to advice. I’m sure that her 
‘Never say die’ attitude is going to help her a lot in the days to come.<O:P> 
</O:P></FONT></P>
<P><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that she has chosen to broaden her technical horizons by pursuing a 
Masters Degree, I wish her all the very best. I’m confident that she will live 
up to your expectations and hence<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I 
strongly recommend her for Graduate Studies at your university and for financial 
assistance .<O:P> </O:P></font></P>

truly,<O:P> </O:P></FONT></P>
