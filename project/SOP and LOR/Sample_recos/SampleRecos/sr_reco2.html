<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation for&nbsp;Mr. ABC as he 
has an indisputable potential and motivation for graduate studies. I have known 
ABC since 1996. During his coursework in Department of Electronic Engineering I 
had the opportunity to closely interact with him in the three semesters that I 
have taught him. This has convinced me that he is very genuine in pursuit of his 
academic excellence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
final year project (Automated Teller Machine) is under my guidance. While 
discussing the concepts of his project work he has been very impressive. He has 
shown excellent capability to understand technical papers, implement those ideas 
and work indefatigably on the modules undertaken thus far.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 
associated with ABC in the sixth and seventh semesters for Microprocessor II &amp; 
III Laboratory Work. His lab-work was disciplined and creditable. He has good 
command over assembly language programming for microprocessors and 
micro-controller.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Academically he is an intelligent and diligent student, which is clearly 
reflected in the excellent marks that he has consistently achieved. He was my 
student for the courses in “Electronics–I” (Semester III), “Microprocessor-II” 
(Semester IV) and presently in “Microprocessor-III” (Semester VII). I imparted 
the concepts of 8086 and its peripherals, 80386 and 8051.&nbsp; His performance in 
these courses has been superior, impressing me with his commitment to learn and 
think innovatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
ABC&nbsp; is a student of high moral and ethical standards. I am sure he will 
put forth all his effort into any task that he confronts.&nbsp; By providing him a 
graduate program in your college you will not only give him an opportunity for 
career growth but also help his achievements to culminate. I recommend him for 
graduate studies and deserving financial assistance. I feel that his academic 
proficiency and potential for research make him one of the truly outstanding 
candidates I have come across.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Yours truly,</font></p>
