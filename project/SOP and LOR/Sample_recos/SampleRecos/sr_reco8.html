<font face="Verdana" size="2">I have known ABC as my student, since the past 
three years, in the subjects of Computer Programming (part 2) , Computer 
Methodology and Algorithms , Computer Organization&nbsp; and Operating systems . I am 
currently teaching her Microprocessors (part 3) as a part of the 7th semester 
curriculum of her B.E. (Computer Engineering) degree course. I have also 
supervised her laboratory work in Computer Methodology and Algorithms and she is 
currently doing her laboratory work in Microprocessors (part 3) under me.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">ABC has excelled in her academic studies, having 
stood fifth among 314 students of all<b> </b>branches in the first year and 
first among 115 students of computer engineering in the second year, thus being 
in the top 1-2<b>&nbsp; </b>% of her class with an average of about 70%.<b> </b>

She has chosen to do her project titled ‘______’, a bulletin board service for 
the college network, in her final year of the Bachelor’s Degree course in 
Computer Engineering. As her guide for this project, I have found ABC to be an 
enthusiastic and committed student with the ability to work in a team and get on 
well with her colleagues. She is also working on a funded research project 
‘Systems Automation using Smart Cards’.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through participation 
in several college activities organized by the Management Society and the 
Computer Chapter of&nbsp; The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc. 
(IEEE), at which she has won prizes, ABC has shown proficiency in 
extra-curricular activities also. Her paper on ‘ Mobile Computing Using IPv6’ 
was selected for presentation at an inter-collegiate paper contest. This shows 
promise of analytical ability and aptitude for research. She has the honesty, 
sincerity and determination to develop into a very capable professional.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">With such a notable academic and extra-curricular 
record, I have no hesitation in recommending her for admission with aid to your 
reputed university for a Master’s Program in Computer Science, in which I am 
quite sure she will acquit herself most creditably. </font></p>
