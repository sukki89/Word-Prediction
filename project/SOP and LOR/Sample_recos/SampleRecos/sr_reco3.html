<span style="font-family: Verdana">ABC<font size="2"> exhibits a high degree of 
initiative in continuously striving to update his knowledge. He ensures that his 
concepts of the subject are clear and therefore, he is an active participant in 
classroom. He is regular in completing his programming assignments, and his 
assignments are among the best in the class. Besides doing so well in academics, 
ABC has been involved in various co-curricular activities. He is a student 
member of the IEEE since the last two years. In his second year of engineering, 
he came first in an intra-collegiate technical quiz organized by the IEEE- 
Communications Chapter. ABC is capable of coping with a lot of hard work, which 
is essential for higher academic attainments, and this, along with his superior 
intellectual ability, makes him an ideal candidate for doctoral studies, in case 
he wishes to continue his education after his masters degree. He is a pleasant 
and well-mannered individual with high moral and social values.</font></span></p>
