Building Presage on MinGW/MSYS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps will enable your system to build and execute
presage in native Win32 mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the current Automated MinGW installer and install the
following components:

    MinGW base tools
    g++ compiler


____________

    (i.e. C:\SQLite3 )

Start MSYS and change into the SQLite3 directory:
    cd /c/SQLite3 

Build the SQLite3 DLL, import library and definition file:
    gcc -shared -o sqlite3.dll sqlite3.c \
    -Wl,--output-def,sqlite3.def,--out-implib,libsqlite3.a


_____________
Build presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start MSYS console

Extract and configure presage, taking care of specifying where to
find required binaries (Python and SWIG), headers, and libraries:

  PATH=/c/Python26:/c/SWIG:$PATH \
  CPPFLAGS="-I/c/SQLite3 -I/c/Python26/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/c/SQLite3" \
  ./configure --prefix=/c/presage
