Building the Windows installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building the Windows NSIS installer requires the following components,
in addition to presage build requirements:

- py2exe
- NSIS

*BEWARE*
The current Windows installer is experimental. Use at your own risk.

Steps:

1) Build presage with MinGW/MSYS and install to a location specified
with --prefix configure option (i.e. /c/presage )

2) Copy setup.py from the trunk/windows directory into the root of the
installation directory (i.e. /c/presage )

3) Check that the PATH is properly setup by running presage_prompter

4) Run: `python setup.py py2exe'. You might have to manually copy the
redistributable MS runtime libraries into the bin directory.

5) Copy the entire contents of the dist directory into the bin
directory

6) In a MinGW/MSYS shell, run the win-buildpackage script:
sh /c/cygwin/home/matt/presage/trunk/windows/win-buildpackage.sh /c/presage 0.7.3

7) You should now have a presage-*-setup.exe in the root of your
presage installation. Congratulations.
